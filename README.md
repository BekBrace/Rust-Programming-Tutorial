Rust Sandbox [code for 15 concepts of Rust language]
This is Amir aka Bek [ancient Egyptian name which happens to be my surname!], and in this blog I am going to talk about Rust!

The first time I've been introduced to Rust was on January 2022, you might think "oh that's pretty new", and I will tell you that the language itself is pretty new, so the first time the stable release of the language was introduced in 2016, first unstable release was in 2011; and originally Rust was a personal project of Graydon Hoare in 2007 who named the language after the Rust fungus; and was sponsored by Moz://a Firefox in 2009.
