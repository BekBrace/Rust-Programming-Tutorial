# Rust-Programming-Tutorial

Rust Sandbox [code for 15 concepts of Rust language].

The first time I've been introduced to Rust was on January 2022, you might think "oh that's pretty new", and I will tell you that the language itself is pretty new, so the first time the stable release of the language was introduced in 2016, first unstable release was in 2011; and originally Rust was a personal project of Graydon Hoare in 2007 who named the language after the Rust fungus; and was sponsored by Moz://a Firefox in 2009.

Rust is the most loved language since 2016 by 86.1 % of 65,000 developers in the 2020 Stack overflow survey.

Rust is statically typed programming language like C, C# or Java, and it's great for creating databases, game engines and even operating system; I've listened yesterday to DISTROTUBE podcast on YT and that's what he said, and I quote :
"It seems like every new program is written in Rust these days. In fact, many older programs are being rewritten in Rust, including a lot of the standard shell utilities. Today, I wanted to briefly mention seven Rust programs that I have installed that I think you should know about."
